# Android App Development - DEH Mini II 

- ### Project Name:
  - DEH Mini II  
- ### Development Period:
  - October 2023 - September 2024  
- ### Description:
  - DEH Mini II is an Android app for exploring cultural and historical POIs, routes, regions, and thematic stories. It integrates with the DEH platform's backend server and database, enabling users to create and interact with cultural content.
  - As the sole Android developer, I revamped the UI, enhanced system logic, and resolved critical bugs to improve functionality and user experience.
